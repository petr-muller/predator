Building Predator on Ubuntu
===========================
Please start with this, ONLY if you are on Ubuntu 10.04:

    sudo apt-get install timeout


This part is common for all versions of Ubuntu we have tried:

    sudo apt-get install cmake curl g++     \
        libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev  \
        gcc-multilib

    make -j3 build_boost build_gcc

    make -j3

    make -i check


Note you need approximately 2 GB of free disk space to unpack and build GCC.
The steps above were successfully tested on Ubuntu 11.04 Desktop (i386 and
amd64) and Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS (Lucid Lynx).
