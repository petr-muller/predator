Building Predator on Ubuntu
===========================
This part is common for all versions of Ubuntu we have tried:

    sudo apt-get install \
        cmake curl g++ gcc-4.6-multilib gcc-4.6-plugin-dev libboost-dev make

    curl http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~idudka/download/predator-2011-10-11-8a7846b.tar.gz \
        | gzip -cd \
        | tar x

    cd predator-2011-10-11-8a7846b

    patch -p1 < build-aux/gcc-4.6.3.patch

    ./switch-host-gcc.sh /usr/bin/gcc-4.6

The steps above were successfully tested on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS.
