Instructions for TACAS 2013 Competition on Software Verification
================================================================

(1) Build Predator from sources.  On Ubuntu 12.04, please follow the
    instructions in docs/README-ubuntu.


(2) Use the 'sl_build/check-property.sh' script to verify each single test-case.

Usage: check-property.sh --task TASK -- path/to/test-case.c [-m32|-m64] [CFLAGS]

    -t, --task TASK
          A verification task. Currently supported tasks:

          'label'   : checks if an error label is reachable
          'memory'  : checks if three memory properties defined in SVCOMP'13
                      MemSafety category rules hold.

    The verification result (TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN) will be printed to
    standard output.  All other information will be printed to standard error
    output.  There is no timeout or ulimit set by this script.  If these
    constraints are violated, it should be treated as UNKNOWN result.  Do not
    forget to use the -m32 option when compiling 32bit preprocessed code on a
    64bit OS.

    For memory safety category, the FALSE result is further clarified as
    FALSE(p) where p is the property for which the Predator judges the
    program to be unsatisfactory.
